This website incorporates different elements discussed in class and it includes 6 webpages that includes things from my 
Wireframe, which is a Homepage, Gallery of Art, About Me page, Pricing tables for Commissions, Form to Contact Me, and a FAQs page that includes images 
on most pages where necessary. I did not include images on the contact page and pricing table page because of formatting issues, 
but the rest of the pages have images.
